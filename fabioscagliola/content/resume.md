### Projects

Here is the list of my major projects.

#### Backend web API supporting a device and its controlling mobile app

2022 - 2023\
The intended use of the device and its controlling mobile app is still confidential.

##### Tasks

Design the software architecture, manage the software development team, develop the solution, design and implement the CI/CD pipeline.

##### Technologies

Clean architecture, DDD, TDD, SCRUM, PostgreSQL, ASP.NET, Azure, Terraform, Visual Studio

#### Web application to manage medical devices

2014 – 2022\
One of the world’s largest manufacturers of blood collection monitors and blood components extractors wanted to introduce a web application to manage their devices. The application had to communicate, on the one hand, with the devices to configure them and exchange data during their operation, and, on the other hand, with the Blood Establishment Computer Software (or BECS) to exchange data about blood collections and blood components extractions.

##### Tasks

Design the software architecture and communication protocols, develop the minimum viable product, manage the software development team, collaborate with Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs to ensure the compliance with ISO 13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, IEC 62366, IEC 60601-1 and -2, and FDA regulations.

##### Technologies

Clean architecture, DDD, TDD, SCRUM, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studio

#### Big data modeling to predict platelet usage and minimize wastage

2020 – 2022\
One of the largest blood centers in the US wanted to develop a web application allowing them to predict the minimum number of platelet units required to satisfy their customers’ demand over the next seven days – platelets units expire after three days. The application had to employ a machine learning model that could predict this number based on the historical data.

##### Tasks

Implement the machine learning model based on a study conducted by Stanford University in 2017, design the software architecture, develop the minimum viable product, manage the software development team, collaborate with Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs to ensure the compliance with IEC 62304, ISO 13485, and FDA regulations.

##### Technologies

#### Mobile app and backend web application to display 3D models in augmented reality

2018\
A large tailor-made furniture manufacturer wanted to allow their customers to preview their furniture in their environment. The mobile app had to use augmented reality to map the empty space and display 3D models of the furniture. The mobile app had to download the models from a backend web application used by the manufacturer to upload new models.

##### Tasks

Design the software architecture, develop both the mobile app and the backend mobile application, train the 3D designers on how to convert the models.

##### Technologies

DDD, TDD, SCRUM, iOS, Swift, ARKit, Xcode, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studio

#### Video game for mobile devices

2014 – 2016\
An independent video game publisher wanted to develop a side-scrolling video game for mobile devices. The game had to support Android, iOS, and Windows Phone, therefore the Ionic framework, built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova, was chosen as its foundation. Unfortunately, two years into the development, the project was canceled, and the video game was never released to the public.

##### Tasks

Design the software architecture, develop the minimum viable product, manage the software development team, collaborate with graphics designers, level designers, and Quality Assurance.

##### Technologies

DDD, TDD, SCRUM, Ionic, AngularJS, EaselJS, PreloadJS

#### Web application to integrate Learning Management Systems with LTI resources

2012\
A large Dutch eLearning company wanted to integrate Learning Management Systems (LMS) that are not compliant with the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specification with LTI resources such as courses or exams. The web application had to act as a proxy between the LMS and the LTI resources in order to allow users to launch courses or exams from the LMS, and to receive the outcome of the courses and exams and transfer it to the LMS.

##### Tasks

Design the architecture in compliance with the LTI specification, develop the solution.

##### Technologies

DDD, TDD, SCRUM, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studio

#### Application to predict the cost of extended surface tubes and heat transfer equipment

1998 – 2020\
One of the world’s largest manufacturers of extended surface tubes (finned tubes and studded tubes) and heat transfer equipment wanted to develop an application to predict the cost of their products based on historical data. The project started as a desktop application (the first version was developed using Visual Basic 6 and an Access database, the second version was developed using WPF and a SQL Server database) and then it evolved into a web application. Over time statistical functions were replaced with a machine learning model.

##### Tasks

Implement the statistical functions, design the software architecture, develop the solution, implement the machine learning model, redesign the architecture.

##### Technologies

DDD, TDD, SCRUM, Visual Basic 6, Access, WPF, machine learning, R, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studio

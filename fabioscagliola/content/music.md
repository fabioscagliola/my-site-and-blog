[Nothence](https://nothence.com) is my personal independent alternative-rock music project, started in 2009.

My fourth instrumental post-rock studio album **Proposed tracks for unproduced movies** was released on December 1, 2018. I had previously released three other studio albums: my favorite one [Post mortem memento vivere](https://pmmv.nothence.com) (September 1, 2016), **Public static void** (March 21, 2014), and **Portrayed by a blind painter** (October 1, 2012).

My latest singles **Welcome to my world** and **Tired** were released on Jul 7, 2022 and on on Aug 5, 2022 respectively, and, just like my albums, they are available on the major music streaming services.

[Nothence](https://nothence.com) is my personal independent alternative-rock music project, started in 2009.

My fourth instrumental post-rock studio album [Proposed tracks for unproduced movies](https://nothence.com/proposed-tracks-for-unproduced-movies.php) was released on December 1, 2018. I had previously released three other studio albums: my favorite one [Post mortem memento vivere](https://pmmv.nothence.com) (September 1, 2016), [Public static void](https://nothence.com/public-static-void.php) (March 21, 2014), and [Portrayed by a blind painter](https://nothence.com/portrayed-by-a-blind-painter.php) (October 1, 2012).

My latest singles [Welcome to my world](https://nothence.com/welcome-to-my-world.php) and [Tired](https://nothence.com/tired.php) were released on Jul 7, 2022 and on on Aug 5, 2022 respectively, and, just like my albums, they are available on the major music streaming services.

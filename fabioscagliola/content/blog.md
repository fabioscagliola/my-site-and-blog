Weird stories, book reviews, articles, and more.

## Vinyl, Cassette, CD, MiniDisc, MP3 & Co.

I started writing [this article](/blog/vinyl-cassette-cd-minidisc-mp3-and-company) in Italian during February 2022, but I never managed to complete it. It was destined to be published on [videohifi.com](https://videohifi.com/), an Italian online magazine codirected by my dear friend Francesco Sorino.

On this very magazine, Francesco had dedicated an [amazing article](https://videohifi.com/nothence) to my personal music project Nothence – I will never thank him enough for that! – and I had published [an article](https://videohifi.com/berriesbo) describing how to build a high-quality streamer using the popular [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) single-board computer, a DAC for the Raspberry Pi manufactured by [HiFiBerry](https://www.hifiberry.com), and software developed in collaboration with none other than Bang & Olufsen.

Unfortunately, in November 2022, Bebo Moroni, who had founded the magazine in 2003, passed away, and Francesco decided to cease the publications.

Today, I have found the time to translate the article to English and decided to publish it here, even if still incomplete: the section about the vinyl records is complete, the section about the cassette is almost complete, the section about the compact disc is complete, the section about the MiniDisc is barely introduced, and the one about MP3 & Co. is completely missing.

Nerdiness alert!

## How Software Excellence Fuels Business Performance

I have recently read the article [Developer Velocity: How software excellence fuels business performance](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance), published by McKinsey & Company on April 20, 2020, which describes the dimensions and drivers that are used to measure what they call the Developer Velocity Index (DVI).

The article highlights that the four dimensions with the greatest impact on business performance are tools, culture, product management, and talent management.

In my article [How Software Excellence Fuels Business Performance](/blog/how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance) I put in my two cents on these four main dimensions, based on my experience.

## Conduits

[Conduits](/blog/conduits) is the sequel to [Hidden Memories](/blog/hidden-memories).

Written as a letter from the protagonist of the first story to her psychiatrist, who has now become her mentor, it recounts three visions she had and she believes them to be of utter importance because they relate to the first hidden memory the psychiatrist chose when she started treating her.

## My Grandfather Used to Know How to Fly

Here is the story of a man who claimed he was able to fly in his youth and then he forgot how to do it as he grew up: [My Grandfather Used to Know How to Fly](/blog/my-grandfather-used-to-know-how-to-fly).

Almost five years ago I released a [song with the same name](https://nothence.bandcamp.com/track/my-grandfather-used-to-know-how-to-fly).

## Diary of a Hospitalization

I wrote my new story [Diary of a Hospitalization](/blog/diary-of-a-hospitalization) with an Orwellian-inspired society in mind. It is a story of loneliness and profound grief, of addiction and haunting ghosts.

I had previously expressed some of the ideas shared by the protagonist about society in my song [Outcast](https://nothence.bandcamp.com/track/outcast).

## The Von Neumann Link

My newest story is called [The Von Neumann Link](/blog/the-von-neumann-link) and it revolves around a science-fictional technology I humbly dedicate to the memory of John von Neumann. It is also a story about pandemics and the consequences of lockdowns on people's mental health.
